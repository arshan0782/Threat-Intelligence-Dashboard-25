**Threat Intelligence UI Dashboard**
_**Project Overview**
_
This project is a modern and interactive web application designed to serve as a dashboard for visualizing threat intelligence data. Built with a robust and scalable stack, it provides a clean and responsive user interface to help security professionals monitor and analyze key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as malicious IP addresses, URLs, and filenames. The application focuses on delivering an intuitive and efficient data-rich experience with smooth user interactions.

**Technical Stack**

This dashboard is built using a modern front-end stack that emphasizes performance, maintainability, and a superior user experience.

Front-End Framework: React with TypeScript

The application is built using React, a powerful component-based library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript is used to ensure type safety, which helps in catching errors early, improving code quality, and enhancing developer productivity.

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development. Its component-based approach ensures a consistent design system and highly maintainable styles.

UI Enhancements:

Framer Motion: Integrated for creating smooth and visually engaging animations and transitions. This library enhances the overall user experience by providing fluid and modern UI interactions.

React Icons: Provides a vast collection of popular, scalable icons that are easy to integrate, improving the clarity and aesthetics of the user interface.

Features (Based on your previous description)

Interactive data visualization using charts and graphs.

Geographic mapping of IP addresses.

A clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface.

Efficient data handling with a mock API (with a scalable architecture for real-world integration).
