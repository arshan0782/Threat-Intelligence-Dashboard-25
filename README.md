Of course. Here is the complete README.md file for your project, including the architecture and build/run instructions based on the technologies you've used.

Threat Intelligence UI Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is a modern web application designed to fetch, display, and interact with threat intelligence feeds. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to visualize key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, URLs, and filenames. The application focuses on delivering a clean, responsive, and data-rich experience.

Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture built on React and Next.js.

Front-End: The user interface is built with React and styled using TailwindCSS for rapid, utility-first development. This approach ensures a modular and maintainable codebase.

State Management: Zustand is used for efficient and lightweight state management. This allows for a global store to handle data from the threat intelligence feeds and manage UI states (like dark mode or filter settings) across the application.

Data Visualization:

Recharts is integrated to create interactive charts and graphs, providing visual summaries of the data.

Leaflet is used to display geographic information, mapping the location of IP addresses for a more insightful view.

Animations: Framer Motion is implemented to create smooth, visually appealing animations and transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Icons: React Icons provides a comprehensive collection of scalable icons to improve UI clarity and aesthetics.

The application fetches data from a mock API, and its architecture is designed to be easily adaptable to a real-world API endpoint.
